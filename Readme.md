Details:
--------

FLICAmain.m is the main file that should be run. However, this file requires the input that is a set of k-dimensional time series where k must be at least two. 

FLICAmain_NoConvexAnalysis.m is another main file without convex hull analysis. This file can run on the input that is a ste of k-dimensional time series where k is one or greater than one.

Please also review varibles description within the file "Varible details.xlsx"
